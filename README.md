## About

RSU Project is a Python project developed by Hiraoka Group at The University of Tokyo for the scientific paper titled: **Rational design of metal-organic cages to increase the number of components via dihedral angle control** by T. Abe, K. Takeuchi, and <INS>S. Hiraoka</INS>. (DOI: [10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-m8m60](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-m8m60))

This project focuses on analyzing Ring Strain per Unit (RSU), which acts as an indicator for estimating purely geometric strains in M<sub>*n*</sub>L<sub>*n*</sub> subcomponent rings in M<sub>6</sub>L<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>9</sub>L<sub>6</sub>, and M<sub>12</sub>L<sub>8</sub> assemblies, where L is 1,3,5-tris(4-pyridyl)benzene and M indicates the metal ion that connects two L with an L–M–L angle of 90°. In the analysis, 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)benzene was used as L instead of 1,3,5-tris(4-pyridyl)benzene, and the ring strain was evaluated for M<sub>*n*</sub>L<sub>*n*</sub> rings (*n* = 2–4) with variable L–M–L angles. For more detailed information, please refer to the associated research paper.
